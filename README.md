### Project Overview
This project is almost like Codepen. It is about to write HTML, CSS and Javascript code in the online editors to make a website and see the output instantly. I have used a package called ### `react-codemirror` to make online editors to write HTML, CSS and Javascript code. I have made a custom hook called ### `useLocalStorage` to store the code in the browser's local storage.
